\title{Minimize a truth table}

\description{
This function performs the QCA minimization of an input truth table, or if the
input is a dataset the minimization it minimizes a set of causal conditions with
respect to an outcome. Three minimization methods are available: the classical
Quine-McCluskey, the enhanced Quine-McCluskey and the latest Consistency Cubes
algorithm that is built for performance.

All algorithms return the same, exact solutions, see
\href{https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-080/}{Dusa (2018)}
and \href{https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0022250X.2014.897949}{Dusa and Thiem (2015)}.

}

\details{
Most of the times, this function takes a truth table object as the \bold{\code{input}} 
for the minimization procedure, but the same argument can refer to a data frame
containing calibrated columns.

For the later case, the function \bold{\code{minimize()}} originally had some additional
formal arguments which were sent to the function \bold{\code{\link[QCA]{truthTable}()}}:
\bold{\code{outcome}}, \bold{\code{conditions}}, \bold{\code{n.cut}},
\bold{\code{incl.cut}}, \bold{\code{show.cases}}, \bold{\code{use.letters}} and
\bold{\code{inf.test}}.

All of these parameters are still possible with function \bold{\code{minimize()}}, but
since they are sent to the \bold{\code{\link[QCA]{truthTable}()}} function anyway, it is
unnecessary to duplicate their explanation here. The only situation which does need
an additional description relates to the argument \bold{\code{outcome}}, where
unlike \bold{\code{\link[QCA]{truthTable}()}} which accepts a single one, the function
\bold{\code{minimize()}} accepts multiple outcomes and performs a minimization for 
each of them (a situation when all columns are considered causal conditions).

The argument \bold{\code{include}} specifies which other truth table rows are
included in the minimization process. Most often, the remainders are included but
any value accepted in the argument \bold{\code{explain}} is also accepted in the
argument \bold{\code{include}}.

The argument \bold{\code{exclude}} is used to exclude truth table rows from the
minimization process, from the positive configurations and/or from the remainders.
It can be specified as a vector of truth table line numbers, or as a matrix of
causal combinations.

The argument \bold{\code{dir.exp}} is used to specify directional expectations, as
described by Ragin (2003). They can be specified using SOP (sum of products)
expressions, which opens up the possibility to experiment with conjunctural
directional expectations. "Don't care" conditions are simply left unspecified.

If at least one of the conditions included in the analysis is multi-value, the
entire \bold{\code{dir.exp}} expression should be specified in multi-value
notation using squared brackets. If a condition X is crisp or fuzzy, the
multi-value notation X[0] is interpreted as its absence, as in the ~X notation.

Activating the \bold{\code{details}} argument has the effect of printing parameters
of fit for each prime implicant and each overall model, the essential prime
implicants being listed in the top part of the table. It also prints the truth
table, in case the argument \bold{\code{input}} has been provided as a data frame
instead of a truth table object.

The default method (when \bold{\code{all.sol = FALSE}}), is to find the minimal number
(\bold{\code{k}}) of prime implicants needed to cover all initial positive output
configurations (minterms), then exhaustively search through all possible disjunctions of
\bold{\code{k}} prime implicants which do cover those configurations.

The argument \bold{\code{min.pin}} introduces an additional parameter to control when to
stop the search for prime implicants. It is especially useful for very large truth tables
and uses an observation by
\href{https://journal.r-project.org/archive/2018/RJ-2018-080/}{Dusa (2018)} that
out of the entire set of non redundant prime implicants, only a subset actually contribute
to minimally solving the PI chart. The search depth is shortened when the PIs found at the
next complexity level do not decrease the minimum \bold{\code{k}}, thus producing absolute
minimal models in both number of disjunctive prime implicants, and their depth level.

Once the PI chart is constructed using the prime implicants found in the previous
stages, the argument \bold{\code{row.dom}} can be used to further eliminate
irrelevant prime implicants when solving the PI chart, applying the principle of row
dominance: if a prime implicant A covers the same (intial) positive output
configurations as another prime implicant B and in the same time covers
other configurations which B does not cover, then B is irrelevant and eliminated.

A large number of causal conditions (i.e. over 15), combined with a large number of cases
(i.e. hundreds) usually produce a very large number of prime implicants, resulting in a huge
and extremely complex PI chart with sometimes thousands of rows and hundreds of columns.

For such a complex PI chart, even finding a minimum is a formidable task, and exhaustively
solving it is very likely impossible in polynomial time. For this reason, after each level
of complexity the CCubes algorithm determines if the PI chart is too difficult, by
calculating the total number of combinations of minimum \bold{\code{k}} PIs necessary to
cover all columns.

The argument \bold{\code{max.comb}} controls this maximum number of combinations. It is a
rational number counted in (fractions of) billions, defaulted at zero to signal searching
to the maximum possible extent. If the total number of combinations exceeds a positive
value of \bold{\code{max.comb}}, the PI chart is determined as too complex, the search is
stopped and CCubes attempts to return all possible models using the PIs from the previous
levels of complexity, when the PI chart was still not too complex. 

In the extreme situation even this is not feasible, the argument \bold{\code{first.min}}
controls returning only one (the very first found) minimal model, if at all possible.
